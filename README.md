Restaurant-DBMS

Overview:
This is a fully custom-built Restaurant Database Management System (DBMS) developed from scratch by me, Bharathraj4035. The project demonstrates my ability to design, implement, and query a relational database tailored for a restaurant's operational needs. It includes table creation, data insertion, and information retrieval queries, showcasing practical SQL skills for managing restaurant data.

Project Features:
Table Creation: Defines the database schema with tables for restaurant entities (e.g., menu, orders, customers).
Data Insertion: Populates the database with sample data to simulate real-world usage.
Information Retrieval: Implements SQL queries for retrieving and analyzing restaurant data (e.g., order details, menu items).

What I Built:
I designed this project from the ground up, including:
Writing Create_tables.sql to establish the database structure.
Developing Insert_values.sql to add initial data.
Crafting information_retrieval_queries.sql for efficient data retrieval and reporting.

Technologies Used:
SQL: Core language for database creation, data insertion, and querying.


Why This Matters:
This project showcases my ability to:
Design a relational database from scratch.
Handle data management tasks relevant to the restaurant industry.
Write efficient SQL queries for real-world applications.
Itâ€™s a valuable addition to my portfolio, demonstrating skills applicable to roles in database administration, data analysis, and software development.

Future Improvements:
Add more complex queries (e.g., joins, aggregations).
Include a front-end interface for user interaction.
Expand the dataset with more realistic scenarios.GitHub: For version control and project hosting.
